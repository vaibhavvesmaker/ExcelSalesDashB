### **Excel Techniques Used**  
#### 1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- **Text-to-Columns**: Split combined fields (e.g., `ship-ctt`, `ship-stt`) into usable geographic data.  
- **TRIM & SUBSTITUTE**: Cleaned inconsistent state names (e.g., "BENGALUKARNATA" â†’ "Karnataka").  

#### 2. **Advanced Analysis**  
- **PivotTables**: Aggregated sales by month, state, gender, and age group.  
- **SUMIFS & COUNTIFS**: Segmented data by categories (e.g., "Kurtas" vs. "Sets") and order status.  
- **XLOOKUP**: Mapped SKUs to product categories for streamlined reporting.  

#### 3. **Dynamic Dashboards**  
- **Interactive Charts**:  
  - **Clustered Column Charts**: Compared monthly sales trends.  
  - **Pie Charts**: Visualized gender and order status distributions.  
- **Slicers & Timelines**: Enabled filtering by date, channel (e.g., Myntra, Amazon), and category.  

#### 4. **Conditional Formatting**
